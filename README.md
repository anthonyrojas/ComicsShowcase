# ComicsShowcase

This is a ASP.NET Core Web API server that can be used to help someone keep track of their comic and comic-related collectibles. By doing so, they can easily catalog their collection and have it on display for other users to see, making this the main use case. Another use case for this service, however, can be to help someone easily sell their collections or parts of it (inspiration for this use case came from Reddit's r/comicswap). At this time, I do not plan on implementing a payment method yet, but that may change.

Will likely deploy to production server for some time.
